# Database Design
My "Principles of Database Design" course final project at AUT.  
The project's objective is to design and manipulate a database for a car factory company.
The project's full description (in Persian) can be found [here](https://github.com/NegarMov/Database-Design/blob/master/Final%20Project%20-%20Description.pdf).  
The phases include designing an ER diagram, normalizing the relations to 2NF, defining tables, adding and editing records, creating views, defining transactions, defining indices, creating a user and granting specific access to it, creating a table for logging purposes, and more.
